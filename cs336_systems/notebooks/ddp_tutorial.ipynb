    "\n",
    "Throughout this portion of the assignment you will be benchmarking distributed applications to better understand the overhead from communication. Here are a few best practices:\n",
    "- Whenever possible, run benchmarks on the same machine to facilitate controlled comparisons.\n",
    "- Perform several warm-up steps before timing the operation of interest. This is especially important for NCCL communication calls. 5 iterations of warmup is generally sufficient.\n",
    "- Call torch.cuda.synchronize() to wait for CUDA operations to complete when benchmarking on GPUs. Note that this is necessary even when calling communication operations with async_op=False, which returns when the operation is queued on the GPU (as opposed to when the communication actually finishes)\n",
    "- Timings may vary slightly across different ranks, so it’s common to aggregate measurements across ranks to improve estimates. You may find the all-gather collective (specifically the dist.all_gather_object function) to be useful for collecting results from all ranks.\n",
    "- In general, debug locally with Gloo on CPU, and then as required in a given problem, benchmark with NCCL on GPU. Switching between the backends just involves changing the init_process_group call and tensor device casts"
